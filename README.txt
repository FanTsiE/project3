notes:
1. remember to free the memory
2. use polymorphism!!!!
3. in Car class, rotate() - rotate around itself, rotate2() - rotate around a certain point
4. remember to randomly generate the UFOs, rockets, teleporters
5. If you have any problems, please contact me! I'm free on Sunday (except 4:00~5:00 pm) and Monday (after 1:00 pm)
